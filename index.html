        <h3>Join the next generation of sandboxes.</h3>
        <p>Sandbox websites are fun. You can do a lot of activities that stimulate a virtual economy and world that keeps you engaged.</p>
        <p>But, they are difficult to make, and often <a>feature security risks</a>, many users want to create their own communities purely because It's fun. And at <a> Anomia </a>, we agree with that statement.</p>
        <img style="margin:auto;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/81/63/d481638425eb29ce67c318bd0fba7d91.jpg" alt="A sandbox" />
        <br />
        <p class="contrast">We created <strong> Castilla </strong>, an open source sandbox solution, that's actuall <strong> maintained, and secure </strong>.</p>
        <p>You probably have seen other open source solutions. But they are most likely either <strong>leaks</strong> or <strong>abandoned projects</strong> which are <a>unmaintained</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>So we asked ourselves. Can we bring something new to the table?</strong></p>
        <p>And the anwer is, yes. We can. And we're doing that.</p>
      </article>

      <h4>Presenting Castilla</h4>
      <details>
        <summary>We ‚ù§Ô∏è Open Source</summary>
        <p>Castilla is 100% Open Source and released under a MIT Licensed slightly modified.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>‚ö° Absurdly Fast and Secure</summary>
        <p>Unlike most sandboxes, Castilla is built around speed and security. Using state-of-the-art technologies like Express & TypeScript for the backend, and lightweight frontend build tools like <kbd>Vite</kbd> with frameworks like <kbd>Svelte</kbd> It's by far the most complete sandbox.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>üîå Plug and Play!</summary>
        <p>Castilla features an automated installer so you only need to focus in what's important:</p>
        <p><strong>Bringing a community together.</strong></p>
        <p>The installer will not only set up the website information but also your database and other important settings.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>üî• No deprecated software</summary>
        <p>Many sandboxes use <strong>old versions of blender</strong> to make their renderers. This methodology is <strong>slow and outdated</strong>.</p>
        <p>Castilla renderer instead is a <code>microservice</code> written in <strong>C</strong> using <kbd>RayLib</kbd></p>
        <p>Blazingly fast and very efficient. [Credits to <strong>Logan</strong> for helping!]</p>

        <h3>The License</h3>
        <p>Castilla has a special Open Source license, which is a fork of the original <a>Apache License </a></p>
        <h5>Using Castilla gives you freedom to:</h5>
        <ins>
          <li>Freely modify the software</li>
          <li>Use the software privately</li>
          <li>Redistribute the software and host it.</li>
        </ins>
        <h5>But we condition you to:</h5>
        <li><mark>Not to commercialize the software</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Not to remove the Castilla watermark</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Always link the original code</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Always use the Castilla license</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Credit properly the developers & maintainers of the project.</mark></li>
        <blockquote>The license is too harsh!</blockquote>
        <p>I (the creator of the project) understand that some of the users might find the license a <strong>bit too extreme</strong> for an open source project. But the work put into this website is tremendous and most of the developers dont receive enough credit for what they do for free as a contribution for a community.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>What happens if I don't respect the license?</summary>
          <p>Unlike <strong>Leaks</strong> or <strong>unmaintained projects </strong>, the open-source license ensures that large services (GitHub, DigitalOcean etc...) won't tolerate license disregards and take down any content that's not properly respecting the license listed above.</p>
          <p>Respect the license, and we're cool!</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Lies we are always told.</summary>
          <blockquote><strong>If people can see the code they can hack it!</strong></blockquote>
          <p>Luckily that's no more than a lie, code-security relies, well, in code. It doesnt matter if they can see it or not, if the code is secure, it will be secure.</p>
          <blockquote><strong>This is just a source of xxxx</strong></blockquote>
          <p>Sadly a lot of users have lost faith in the Sandbox Community, and I can't really blame them. Projects like this <a>seem unreal because they're too good</a>.</p>
          <p>Castilla does not run sources, It's all code written by different maintainers who love what they do. From scratch, clearly.</p>
          <blockquote><strong>You are going to charge for this project and paywall features.</strong></blockquote>
          <p>Castilla will never be paywalled. Never. It is open source and will always stay like it. I don't plan nor I want to make any money out of this project. It's purely free and open source. Embracing the FOSS freedoms.</p>
          <blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</blockquote>
          <blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).</blockquote>
          <blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).</blockquote>
          <p>By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.</p>

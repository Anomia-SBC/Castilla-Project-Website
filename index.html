        <details>
          <summary>Can I just host this?</summary>
          <p><strong> You can! </strong> but with a catch! This is <strong> Open Source Software</strong> which means I, (the creator and maintainer of the project) make 0$ out of it. Thus the only condition of this is that you leave the footer that links to the project. All of what has been mentioned goes into the <a>License </a></p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How fast is this?</summary>
          <p>Stupidly fast enough to handle large ammounts of requests with ease. During development I made sure the code was escalable, and it is.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What different ways of hosting are there?</summary>
          <p>Castilla supports quite a few hosting methods, from cloud to bare metal, we give native support.</p>

          <summary>What happens if I don't respect the license?</summary>
          <p>Unlike Bopimo and Vertinner leaks (which are unlicensed), open source software is protected behind a license that acts as a shield. GitHub, Digital Ocean, Cloudflare and many other services most developers use make sure that their clients respect the license of the software hosted too. Specially open source one. If someone is found not respecting the license, it takes 10 minutes to contact and take down a website until it is liable to the conditions listed before. This is not a threat, just a warning since as mentioned above, it's a lot of work to maintain this project...</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I need to open source my site to use Castilla?</summary>
          <p>No need! Castilla is made so you can keep it as private as you want. But always keeping in mind the conditions listed in the license.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Why the name?</summary>
          <p>Castilla is a province in Spain, I find myself living close to it, and like it's name. Thus the project name!</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Why are you doing this project?</summary>
          <p>I'm tired of seeing Bopimo websites getting their data leaked and websites down, It's sad and dangerous for the average user. Who might not be able of seeing how bad the situation is. Since Bopimo is unmaintained, and It's former developers (Firecatmagic etc...) encourage people not to use it, there is no real good <strong> Open Source and Maintained Solution </strong>.</p>
          <p><a>There are some open source websites</a> but they are completely unmaintained, or the developers don't hold good reputation amongst the community.</p>
